# Mern Blog

This application was created using the mern stack (mongo db, expressJS, react, nodeJS). This was mainly created to have a blog on my portforlio website. Though would be nice to build and have my own features that I want. 

## To run Locally

At the moment I haven't dockerized the application yet but will in the near future. So if you wish to run this locally you have to do 2 things.

You need to open 2 terminals.

In one terminal do the following

```cd api```

then

```npm install```

this will install the depandancies. Once done then you need to type

```node index.js```

this will start the server. The server will use port 4000.

Once that is done on the other terminal you need to change the directory to the client folder.

```cd client```

once here you need to do the same as before and install the dependancies

```npm install```

once done run the command

```npm start```

this will start the front-end and will run on port 3000. Once both are up and running you can begin to use the application.
